# CLASSIFICATION-PRJ
A cancer prediction classification model is an algorithmic approach that uses machine learning techniques to analyze data and predict the likelihood of an individual developing cancer. It is designed to classify individuals into different categories based on the probability of having cancer.
## Dataset
The model is trained on a carefully curated dataset that includes demographic information, medical history, genetic factors, lifestyle habits, and results from diagnostic tests. The dataset is labeled with the corresponding cancer status (positive or negative) for each individual. The dataset used for training and evaluation can be found in the `data` directory.
